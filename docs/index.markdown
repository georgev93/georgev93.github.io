# Intro

This website is a collection of my ramblings to hopefully shed some light on some useful concepts. I'll do my best to explain based on what I've learned through exploring these concepts myself. You can scroll on down to the "Concepts" section of this page if you know what you want to know, or continue on to the "Scenarios" section to hear what I think you should know when you find yourself in certain scenarios. Keep in mind, many of these scenarios are complimentary, so you might find that you're in multiple of these scenarios simultaneously!

## Scenarios

Here are concepts I think you should be familiar with for the following scenarios:

 1. The "*I want to host my own Plex server for watching live TV and/or hosting my own media*" scenario
  - Port Forwarding
  - Media encoding
  - Containers
 2. The "*I want to maintain a large pool of backup storage at home*" scenario
  - RAID Topologies
  - SMB Shares
  - File Permissions
 3. The "*I want to block ads on my home network*" scenario
  - [DNS (Domain Name Service)](./concepts/primers/dns.html)
  - Containers

## Concepts

### Home Servers

 - Port Forwarding
 - Media encoding
 - Containers

### NAS (Network Attached Storage)

- RAID Topologies
- SMB Shares
- File Permissions

### Primers

These concepts are more fundamental/generic computer science and networking concepts that may be needed to understand the higher level concepts presented on this site.

 - [DNS (Domain Name Service)](./concepts/primers/dns.html)
 - NAT (Network Address Translation)
 - IP Addresses
 - [Computer hardware](./concepts/primers/hardware.html)
 - Containers
